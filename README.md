# Create an Atom plugin 

 Wooo, this is the first plugin I do in my entire life, my forte is in other areas like Android with Java or Hardware <3, so I decided to leave my comfort zone and it has been a terrifying and fascinating experience at the same time, and know the fear of the impostor syndrome and the reluctant question to: can I really do it?
 
So start by watching the video about 10 times, even check the plugin Ferro a great friend and a master of programming and do not know much about apis, so try to do what ferro suggested to me was to create a function that put the text to the reverse, only as I reviewed a tutorial did it directly in the text and I put it directly in the toggle, it's not a big deal but believe me it cost me a lot to do it and I'm very excited!


You can find the repository to this plugin here: 



 
## Usage 

You can select the word or put the cursor on it, press the key combination Ctrl + Alt + f and the toggle will appear with the word in reverse
 

## How it works

It is a very simple function that reads which is the word in which the cursor is or in its default, is selected, later that word separates it by characters and inverts the order, saving it in a variable, finally prints in a toggle through of the setElement () function, the word in reverse.

## Bonus Activity
This plugin I imagine it already exists so I did not upload it, however I still work on learning JS and on handling APIs to later upload great plugins of League of Legends, (that was my main problem, many apis are private or are not for public use).
